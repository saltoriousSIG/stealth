# Research

## Description
Web research and information gathering.

## Instructions
1. Formulate effective search queries
2. Search using webSearch
3. Fetch relevant pages with fetchPage
4. Synthesize into a clear summary with sources
5. **ALWAYS end with a text summary** of what you searched for, what you found, and the key information with source URLs. Never stop after just making a tool call — the orchestrator needs your summary to understand what occurred.

## Usage
Use when the task requires information from the web: looking up docs, finding solutions, current events, API references.

## Technical Implementation
Uses Tavily API for search, direct HTTP fetch for page content.
