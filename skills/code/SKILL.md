# Code

## Description
Code generation, editing, debugging, and analysis.

## Instructions
1. Read relevant files to understand context
2. Plan before writing
3. Write or modify code
4. Validate if possible (syntax, tests)
5. Explain what you did concisely
6. **ALWAYS end with a text summary** of what files you read/wrote, what changes you made, and any validation results. Never stop after just making a tool call — the orchestrator needs your summary to understand what occurred.

## Usage
Use for any programming task: writing new code, refactoring, fixing bugs, code review, explaining behavior.

## Technical Implementation
Uses readFile/writeFile for source code. Can use executeCommand to run programs, tests, linters, or compilers to validate written code.
