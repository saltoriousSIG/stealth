# Files

## Description
File system operations: read, write, search, and organize.

## Instructions
1. Verify paths exist before operating
2. Execute the file operation
3. Confirm success
4. **ALWAYS end with a text summary** of what files you read/wrote/listed, the key contents or results, and whether the operation succeeded. Never stop after just making a tool call — the orchestrator needs your summary to understand what occurred.

## Usage

## Technical Implementation
